# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Python FastAPI backend service for a fintech application. The backend will provide REST API endpoints covering core financial services including dashboard analytics, card management, account operations, transactions, money transfers, investments, and savings management.
